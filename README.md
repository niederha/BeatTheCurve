# BeatTheCurve
## Inspiration
We think that people aren’t really aware of the impact of preventive measures they are asked to take. They might feel that they are being forced upon them in a negative way. We’d like for them to first understand why the measures are needed and then take ownership of what they do through positive reinforcement. 

## What it does
**Informs users:** it shows and explains why measures/recommendations are taken through the use of interactive pandemic spread simulations where users can change different parameters (type of restrictions, how well people apply them, social distancing, shops/schools closed or open, etc.). This allows them to have a better grasp and understanding of the impact of restrictions and their behaviours.
In addition, it also shows the current state of the propagation of the virus.

**Positive reinforcement:** it encourages people to apply the recommended measures by rewarding users when they record their good habits on the app. The reward is implemented through gamification (trophies, points, ...) in order to highlight the positive impact of users’ behaviours (by displaying how the epidemic would spread if everyone had the same behaviour vs how it would spread with no measures taken, by estimating the number of infections avoided by the users, etc.).
