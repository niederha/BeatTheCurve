var vf=["id001","Question","réponse complète", 1];

var vf1=["id001"," It doesn’t matter how long I wash my hands as long as I use soap ",
"False. Studies show that you should scrub your hands with soap for a minimum of 15-30 seconds in order to effectively remove germs.", 0];

var vf2=["id002","Hand sanitizers are less efficient than washing your hands with soap and water",
"True. Washing hands with soap and water is the best and most effective way to reduce the number of microbes and germs on hands.", 1];

var vf3=["id003","The hotter the water you use for handwashing, the better",
"False. Hotter water can also dry out skin, which leaves your skin more susceptible to germs and can make handwashing painful. It is best to wash your hands with the temperature that you find comfortable.", 0];

var vf4=["id004","You should dry your hands after washing them",
"True. Studies show that germs can be more easily transferred to and from wet hands, which is why drying hands is essential to staving off bacteria after handwashing.", 1];

var vf5=["id005","Hand dryers are less hygienic than paper towels",
"True. It has been found that paper towels are superior to air dryers and can help remove bacteria, unlike air dryers which can spread bacteria between three and six feet from the device.", 1];

var vf6=["id006","Exposing yourself to the sun or temperatures higher than 25°C does not prevent the coronavirus disease",
"True. You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. To protect yourself, make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose. ", 1];

var vf7=["id007","Catching the new coronavirus means you will have it for life",
"False. Most of the people who catch COVID-19 can recover and eliminate the virus from their bodies. If you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms. If you have cough, fever, and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early – but call your health facility by telephone first. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.", 0];

var vf8=["id008","Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort means you are free from the coronavirus disease",
"False. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and fever. Some people may develop more severe forms of the disease, such as pneumonia. The best way to confirm if you have the virus producing COVID-19 disease is with a laboratory test. You cannot confirm it with this breathing exercise, which can even be dangerous.", 0];

var vf9=["id009","Drinking alcohol protects you against COVID-19",
"False. Frequent or excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of health problems.", 0];

var vf10=["id010","COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates",
"True. From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19.", 1];

var vf11=["id011","Cold weather and snow cannot kill the new coronavirus",
"True. There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather.", 1];

var vf12=["id012","Taking a hot bath prevents the new coronavirus disease",
"False. Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you.", 0];

var vf13=["id013"," There isn’t a treatment for the COVID-19 disease",
"True. As this is a new virus, no vaccine is currently available. Healthcare providers are mostly using a symptomatic approach, meaning they treat the symptoms rather than target the virus. In severe and critically ill patients, a number of drugs are being tried to target the virus, but the use of these need to be more carefully assessed in randomised controlled trials.", 1];

var vf14=["id014","The new coronavirus can be transmitted through mosquito bites",
"False. To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.", 0];

var vf15=["id015","I can use an ultraviolet disinfection lamp to kill the new coronavirus",
"False. UV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.", 0];

var vf16=["id016","Thermal scanners can detect any person infected with the new coronavirus",
"False. Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.", 0];

var vf17=["id017","Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body cannot kill the new coronavirus",
"True. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.", 1];

var vf18=["id018","Vaccines against pneumonia protects you against the new coronavirus",
"False. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.", 0];

var vf19=["id019","Regularly rinsing your nose with saline help prevent infection with the new coronavirus",
"False. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus.", 0];

var vf20=["id020","Eating garlic does not help prevent infection with the new coronavirus",
"True. Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.", 1];

var vf21=["id021","Antibiotics are effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus",
"False. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only against bacteria. The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.", 0];

var vf22=["id022","There are no specific medicine to prevent or treat the new coronavirus",
"True. To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials.", 1];

var vf23=["id023","People suffering from pollen allergy or allergies in general have a higher risk to develop severe disease when having COVID-19",
"False. Allergies, which include allergic rhinitis caused by pollen, have not been identified as a major risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the studies available so far. Moderate to severe asthma on the other hand, where patients need treatment daily, is included in the chronic lung conditions that predispose to severe disease.", 0];

var vf24=["id024","Face masks aren’t effective in protecting against COVID-19 if you aren’t infected",
"True. If you are infected, the use of surgical face masks may reduce the risk of you infecting other people. On the other hand there is no evidence that face masks will effectively prevent  you from becoming infected with the virus. In fact, it is possible that the use of face masks may even increase the risk of infection due to a false sense of security and increased contact between hands, mouth and eyes while wearing them. The inappropriate use of masks also may increase the risk of infection.", 1];

var vf25=["id025","There isn’t a risk of COVID-19 infection from food products imported from affected",
"True. There has been no report of transmission of COVID-19 via food, and therefore there is no evidence that food items imported into the European Union in accordance with the applicable animal and public health regulations pose a risk for the health of EU citizens in relation to COVID-19. The main mode of transmission is from person to person.", 1];

var vf26=["id026","There is a slight risk of COVID-19 infection from contact with pets and other animals in the EU",
"True. Current research links COVID-19 to certain types of bat as the original source, but does not exclude the involvement of other animals. There is no evidence that companion animals (e.g. dogs or cats) pose a risk of infection to humans, however there is one report from Hong Kong of a pet dog that had positive swabs and showed serological evidence that it was likely infected by its owner who got COVID-19. As a general precaution, it is always wise to observe basic principles of hygiene when in contact with animals.", 1];

var vf27=["id027","There is a risk of getting COVID-19 from packages delivered through the postal system",
"False. A recent study published by The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) reported that the causal agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is able to persist for up to 24 hours on cardboard, in experimental settings (e.g. controlled relative humidity and temperature). In practice however there is no evidence of the infection ever being transmitted through contaminated packages that are exposed to different environmental conditions and temperatures.", 0];

var vf28=["id028", "It isn’t effective for people to be checked for COVID-19 at the airport when arriving from areas of local or community transmission",
 "True.There is evidence that checking people at the airport by reading their skin temperature (known as entry screening) is not very effective in preventing the spread of the virus, especially when people do not have symptoms. It is generally considered more useful to provide those arriving at airports with clear information explaining what to do if they develop symptoms after arrival.", 1]

 var a1=["COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-1", "SARS-CoV-2"]
 var q1=["id01","What is the name of the disease associated to the coronavirus ?","COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a the new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans causing the disease.", a1];
  
 var a2=["All of the above", "Bats", " Camels and cats"]
 var q2=["id02","Where do coronaviruses come from?","Coronaviruses are viruses that circulate among animals with some of them also known to infect humans. Bats are considered natural hosts of these viruses, yet other species can also transmit the disease. For example, MERS-CoV is transmitted to humans from camels, SARS-CoV-1 is transmitted to humans from civet cats.", a2];
  
 var a3=["2 to 3 people", "1 to 2 people", "100 people"]
 var q3=["id03","If a person is infected, to how many others could it pass the disease on average ?","There is not enough epidemiological information at this time to determine how easily this virus spreads between people, but it is currently estimated that, on average, one infected person will infect between two and three other people.", a3];
  
 var a4=["The incubation period for COVID-19 is currently estimated to be a month.", "The virus is transmitted via small respiratory droplets through sneezing, coughing...", "The virus can survive on different surfaces from several hours up to a few days."]
 var q4=["id04","Which statement is false ?","The incubation period for COVID-19 (i.e. the time between exposure to the virus and onset of symptoms) is currently estimated to be between one and 14 days.", a4];
  
 var a5=["Up to 14 days", "3 days", "3 months"]
 var q5=["id05","How long does the infectious period last ?","The infectious period may begin one to two days before symptoms appear, but people are likely most infectious during the symptomatic period, even if symptoms are mild and very non-specific. The infectious period is now estimated to last for 7-12 days in moderate cases and up to two weeks on average in severe cases.", a5];
  
 var a6=["20-30%", "1-5%", "40-50%"]
 var q6=["id06","What is the proportion of people hospitalised due to COVID-19 ?","Preliminary data from the EU/EEA (from the countries with available data) show that around 20-30% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases are hospitalised and 4% have severeillness. Hospitalisation rates are higher for those aged 60 years and above, and for those with other underlying health conditions.", a6];
  
 var a7=["Elderly people and those with underlying health conditions", "Children with no underlying health conditions", "Females underlying health conditions"]
 var q7=["id06","Which category of people is the most at risk?","Elderly people above 70 years of age and those with underlying health conditions are considered to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms. Men in these groups also appear to be at a slightly higher risk than females. Children appear as likely to be infected as adults, but they have a much lower risk than adults of developing symptoms or severe disease.", a7];
  
 var a8=["Contact healthcare services online or by phone", "Go to the hospital directly", "Buy over-the-counter drugs"]
 var q8=["id08","What should you do if you feel ill with COVID-19 symptoms (fever, cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain or general weakness) ?"," If you are feeling ill with COVID-19 symptoms, it is recommended that you contact your local healthcare services online or by telephone. If your healthcare provider believes there is a need for a laboratory test for the virus that causes COVID-19, he/she will inform you of the procedure to follow and advise where and how the test can be performed.", a8];
  
 var a9=["Hoarding toilet paper rolls at home", "Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands", "Washing your hands with soap and water"]
 var q9=["id09","Which proposition isn’t a good preventive measure?","The virus enters your body via your eyes, nose and/or mouth, so it is important to avoid touching your face with unwashed hands. Washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or cleaning hands thoroughly with alcohol-based solutions, gels or tissues is recommended in all settings. It is also recommended to stay one metre or more away from people infected with COVID-19 who are showing symptoms, to reduce the risk of infection through respiratory droplets.", a9];
  
 var a10=["Predictions aren’t currently reliable", "A year", "5 months"]
 var q10=["id10","How long will this outbreak last?","Any predictions about when the peak will come and how long the outbreak will last are purely speculative at this stage. As greater evidence emerges regarding the nature of the virus and the effectiveness of measures used to control the outbreak, predictions relating to the future course of COVID-19 will become more reliable.", a10];
